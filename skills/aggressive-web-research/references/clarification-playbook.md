# Clarification Playbook

Ask exactly one targeted clarification question when output shape or scope is ambiguous.

## Primary Question

"Do you want a conservative official-only summary, or an exhaustive matrix with official docs plus secondary corroboration and explicit uncertainty?"

## Scope Dimensions

Infer and confirm these dimensions quickly:

- Services list (which products)
- Time window (current snapshot vs historical changes)
- Region/currency assumptions
- Output shape (quick bullets vs matrix)

## Defaults If User Does Not Clarify

- Use exhaustive matrix mode
- Prioritize official pricing + official docs + official changelog/blog
- Add secondary sources only for conflict diagnosis
- Avoid exact values when not source-confirmed
- Surface unknowns instead of guessing
