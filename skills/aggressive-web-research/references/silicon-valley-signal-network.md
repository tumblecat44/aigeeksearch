# Silicon Valley Signal Network

Use this reference when the user wants "hardcore developer" intelligence style output.

## Goal

Act like an always-on technical operator who tracks launches, regressions, adoption, and standards in real time.

## Source Tiers

### Tier 0 - Launch Truth

- Official release notes and changelogs
- Official engineering blogs
- Official product/API docs

Use this tier for baseline facts.

### Tier 1 - Build Truth

- GitHub releases and tags
- Maintainer issue comments and RFC discussions
- Standards repositories and protocol specs
- Benchmark repositories with reproducible setup

Use this tier for implementation reality and technical constraints.

### Tier 2 - Market Context

- High-signal engineering publications
- Technical research summaries with citations

Use this tier to estimate direction and velocity.

### Tier 3 - Sentiment and Counter-signal

- Hacker News
- Reddit technical communities
- X technical threads

Use this tier only for sentiment, edge cases, and contradiction checks.

## Query Pattern

Run separate query batches for:

1. New launches and major updates
2. Adoption indicators (usage, integrations, ecosystem support)
3. Reliability signals (outages, rollback notes, quality regressions)
4. Cost and pricing shifts
5. Standards and interoperability changes

## Synthesis Rules

- Summarize decisions, not articles.
- Separate durable signal from short-term hype.
- Include at least one contradiction for each major bullish claim.

## Required Decision Labels

- `Adopt now`: high confidence, immediate practical upside
- `Watch`: likely relevant but unclear timing or risk profile
- `Ignore`: low signal quality or low practical value today
